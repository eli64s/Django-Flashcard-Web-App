# Django Flashcard Web-App

Hello! This project is a flashcard web-application utilizing Python, Django, SQLite3, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap.
The primary feature of this project is flipping flashcards that belong to card sets (deck). I designed the 
flashcards around vocabulary words, but there are many directions one can go with this code. Additionally,
I have been coding for years in the analytics realm, but this is my first web-development project and have
really enjoyed the process so far.

Highlights of Project:
  1) This project has two models - a card and a deck 
  
  2) A page for selecting the deck of cards to study

  3) A page for viewing the flashcards with features including:
     - Hover to flip the card
     - Next/Previous/Random buttons to navigate the deck 
     - Option to write vocabulary word in a sentence
